            <h2 class="section-heading">Window System with Automatic control and Fire Notification</h2>

            <p>In the case of opening window and being outside of house, the raindrops can come and wet the
laundry.</p>

            <p>In addition, In the case of when a fire occurs in an apartment, the fire can go through the open
window</p>

            <p>This study aims to integrate two devices using open source; a sensor that closes the window
when it rains and enables the owner to control the window using blutooth from his or her smartphone. and
a flame detecter.</p>

            <p>Keywords : Automatic control, Smartphone, Bluetooth, Open source</p>

            <p> 1. Motivation</p>
            <p>There will be more than one or two occasions where I have had a shower experience when I go outdoors with my window open. If you leave your laundry out of the way, you will have to do your laundry again, but there are molds around the windows that can be troublesome. In a building like an apartment, a fire alarm is located in the kitchen or in the center of the water, but in the event of a fire, it is very likely to spread with the wind through windows. Therefore, in this paper, it is automatically closed when rain comes, and it is a goal to integrate a device that controls the degree of opening of a window through a Bluetooth connection of an individual smartphone and a device that notifies a siren when a flame is detected.</p>

            <p> 2. Development Environment And Sensor Used</p>
            <p>It was developed by the editions of Windows 10 Education, using Arduino IDE version 1.8.5 and Google App Inventor 2</p>



            <a href="#">

            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Sensor Chart</span>


            <p> 3. Use open source</p>
            <p> Using the ArduinoThread (MIT lisence) of ivanseidel, we paralleled the automatic control function and the fire notification function, and operated the servomotor to move the window using the Servo (GNU language).</p>

            <p> 4. Features and Interfaces</p>
            <p> When the device was turned on, the window control and flame detection sensors were paralleled by alternating operations at 1ms intervals by the Thread library. Users can download the app created with App Inventor and operate it, and the current temperature can be checked through Arduino's temperature sensor. When you press the window automatic setting button when you go out, when the water comes into the rain water sensor, the resistance value decreases. If the value falls below the set value, the window automatically closes. If it exceeds the set value, the window is opened for ventilation. In addition, you can control the degree of opening fully closed, half open / close, fully open.</p>
            <p> The flame detection sensor is measured at intervals of 200 ms. In normal times, the RGB LED keeps the green light, and when a certain flame is detected, the red light is flickered and the siren is set to sound.</p>

            <p> 4. Experiments and results</p>

            <p> In order to check the operation of the device, it was confirmed that each part was processed in parallel by connecting the power source. After setting the value of each rain sensor and flame sensor at a medium value, I can confirm that it works.</p>

            <p> 5. conclusion </p>
            <p> There are many people who are affected by ever-changing climate change. In this paper, we have designed and developed automatic control windows and fire notification window devices and applications to solve these problems, and confirmed that they work properly. It is expected that this will provide not only convenience, but also a safer preparation for safety.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Hwasun Local Swimming Pool Management Database Program</h2>

            <p> 1. Motivation</p>
            <p> When I was in vacation, I would go swimming with my friends and a public facility in Hwasun County near the area. The purpose is to create a database program to manage this swimming facility.</p>
            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Swimming.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
            <p> 2. Purpose of Development</p>
            <p> Although there are staff members in the facility, realistic swimwear rental management, sale of goods, and facility use time are not managed. The aim of this program is to compensate for the insufficiency of such management.</p>


            <p> 3. Development Environment</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize thereâ€™s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
